A little tool to help reason about semantic versioning.

Inspired by the extremely useful [explainshell.com](http://explainshell.com).

## Limitations
Not all versioning schemes have been implemented yet. The list of currently supported versioning schemes is as follows (in order of most confusing):
- [X] Caret
- [X] Tilde
- [ ] Prerelease/build postfix
- [ ] Support for other versioning schemes (like some extra that are available with pip)
- [ ] Range based
